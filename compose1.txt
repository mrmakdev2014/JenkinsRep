services:
  jenkins:
    image: jenkinsci/jenkins
    ports: 
      - 9999:8080
    container_name: jenkins
    volumes:
      - ./jenkins:/var/jenkins_home:rw



      the volumes target in to keep the image content even we stop the container
      once run "docker-compose up -d" the folder "jenkins" will created but the folder need permissions 
      so we must use

    >> sudo chmod 777 jenkins
